--- Getting Started with Python ---

Generally when we write something in python the interpreter converts it to the machine level language and return us the output. 

So when you give 5/2 -> The result is 2.5 -> It’s a floating point division in python

5 // 2 -> 2 - It is. Floor division or integer division. 

BODMAS rule is applied
Bracket Orders Divide Multiply Add Subtract

2 **3 = 2^3 = 8 -> ** is power of here. 

String is nothing but a combination of characters. 

Print("navin\'s laptop") -> backlash before the special character makes the character normal. 

10 * 'anil' -> it will print anil name for 10 times. 

Print(r'c:\docs\string') -> It is a raw string, we are syaing to python don’t try to convert it to a special string. 

'a' + 'b' -> ab -> concatenation



--- Variables in Python ---

Variable is a block where you have values. 

_ represents the output of previous operation in python

In computer numbering always starts with 0

If you give - number in an array in strings then it will consider from last character from right to left it will consider and print. 

Strings in python are immutable. We cannot change the value of those. 

Myname = 'anil'
Len(myname) = 4 
LEN FUNCTION gives you the length of the string.
